        Log in via Twitch to get your customized mod zip file. Your Twitch credentials are not stored, and are
        only used to identify which streamer's wands page to update as you play the game.

        Download your customized mod zip bundle below. The bundle marked "latest" is recommended, older versions
        may not work correctly but are provided for your convenience. <strong>Do not share this zip file with others!</strong>
        The mod bundle includes credentials that identify which streamer page to update. If another user installs the same
        zip bundle, they will be sending wand updates to <em>your</em> stream page!
      h2.progress Progress Instructions
      p.
        Spells and Perks progress is fully tracked by streamer-wands and requires no additional steps by you.
        Enemy progress is tracked assuming you are on a clean save file (AKA no enemy progress), if you want 
        tracking to start from your current enemy progress follow the below steps:<br><br>
        1. Click "browse" on the file selector below
        1. Browse to your <strong>%appdata%/LocalLow/Nolla_Games_Noita/save00/stats/_stats.salakieli</strong><br>
        1. Download the stats.lua file<br>
        1. Move the stats.lua inside streamer-wands, root directory so right next to token.lua and mod.xml<br>
        Note. If you get any enemy progress while the mod is disabled, you will have to re-go through these 3 steps
        in order for enemy progress to be accurate again

        Chrome is currently complaining about the zip file as an "uncommon file", so you may need to take an extra step to
        complete the download. See these images:
